# StayConnected
StayConnected is an online application aimed to keep alumni and current students in the Software Engineering Graduate Program at the University of Scranton connected while they are in the program and after they have graduated.  Currently, alumni and current students do not have a convenient way to stay in touch with each other, but Stay Connected aims to fix this problem. 

StayConnected was created using Java SpringBoot, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Thymeleaf for the class SE516 at the University of Scranton.  

Below are some screenshots from the project.  The beautiful UI was created by [Parth](https://github.com/parthshahoo7/).
